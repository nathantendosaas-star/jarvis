cloud_review.py

Implements LOCAL_MODEL_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md Task 4: when back online, staged
changes produced by the local model get reviewed by a cloud model before
they're allowed to merge into the real workspace.

Defaults to OpenRouter (matches Nathan's existing CLI agent setup — see
OPENROUTER_API_KEY / OPENROUTER_MODEL env vars) since that's already wired
into his other projects. Swapping to Gemini directly is a ~10 line change in
_call_reviewer_model() if preferred — the diff-building and manifest logic
above it don't need to change either way.

If no API key is configured, review_staged_changes() degrades gracefully:
it returns approved=False with a clear "no reviewer configured" message
instead of crashing, so the bridge endpoint stays usable in dev without
secrets set.
